# Cut a release locally: regenerate CHANGELOG.md, stage it, and (optionally) make the release
# commit with the '[release]' marker that the CI workflow (release.yml) looks for, then push.
#
# Usage (from repo root):
#   .\Release.ps1                        # regenerate CHANGELOG.md + stage it, then commit yourself
#   .\Release.ps1 -Message "msg"         # also commit (marker '[release]' is appended if missing)
#   .\Release.ps1 -Message "msg" -Push   # also push -> triggers the CI release build
#
# Prerequisite: the tag 'M.N.0' for the current minor line must already exist on origin
# (git tag M.N.0; git push origin M.N.0). CI builds M.N.<commits-since-tag> and attaches the
# nupkg to the GitHub Release 'M.N.0'.
